## üîß Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **City Detail Page 404 Errors** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** City detail pages were calling backend directly instead of using Next.js API proxy, causing 404 errors when backend was unavailable.

**Solution:** 
- Updated all city data fetching to use Next.js API routes (`/api/cities/[slug]`)
- Implemented robust fallback to mock data when backend is down
- Ensured consistent data structure across all pages

**Impact:** City pages now load reliably with proper fallbacks, maintaining excellent UX even during backend outages.

### 2. **Leaflet Marker Assets 404 Errors** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Missing marker icon files causing 404 errors and broken map markers.

**Solution:**
- Added proper Leaflet marker assets to `/public/cities/`
- Updated all map components to use correct asset paths
- Implemented consistent marker styling across all maps

**Impact:** All maps now display properly with visible markers and professional appearance.

### 3. **API URL Inconsistencies** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Mixed usage of `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` vs `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` causing API call failures.

**Solution:**
- Standardized all API calls to use Next.js API proxy routes
- Updated homepage, cities page, and explore page to use consistent API endpoints
- Ensured proper environment variable usage

**Impact:** All API calls now work reliably with proper error handling and fallbacks.
